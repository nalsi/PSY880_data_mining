## Question 1

#### (a) Complete linking

``` {R fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2.8}

data <- data.frame(A = c(0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.7),
                   B = c(0, 0, 0.5, 0.8),
                   C = c(0, 0, 0, 0.45),
                   D = c(rep(0, 4)))

distance <- as.dist(data)

plot(hclust(distance, 
            method = "complete"),
     main = "Hierarchical clustering - complete linking",
     xlab = "", sub = "")

```

#### (b) Single linking

``` {R fig.width = 4, fig.height = 2.8}

plot(hclust(distance, 
            method = "single"),
     main = "Hierarchical clustering - complete linking",
     xlab = "", sub = "")

```

#### (c) & (d) Cutting dendogram

For the first dendogram, A & B are in the first cluster, C & D the second. 

For the second dedogram, D is in its own cluster, while the other three in another cluster.

#### (e)
